## App Icon

For a production application, you should add a proper `app.ico` file here.

You can create one using:
- Online tools like https://www.icoconverter.com/
- Design tools like GIMP, Photoshop, or Inkscape
- Windows built-in icon editor

The icon should be 256x256 pixels or higher for best results.

For now, the application will use a default Windows icon until a custom `app.ico` is added.
